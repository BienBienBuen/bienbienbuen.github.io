## 🦁🦁🦁

I'm Suyang (Ben), a senior @ University of Hong Kong, majoring in Mathematics (intensive) and minoring in physics. 

I'm interested in a wide range (perhaps a bit too wide) of applied topics, having dabbled in quantum mechanics to game theory and mathematical finance. My main interest as of now is theoretical/statistical maching learning, but theoretical physics always has a soft spot in my heart and I'm always trying to learn more about it.
