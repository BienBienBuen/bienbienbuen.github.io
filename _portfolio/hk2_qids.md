## Project Overview

At HKU's Quantitative Investment and Data Science Society, I was tasked with investigating market microstructure and behaviours, characterised by stylized facts, and matching mechanism of exchanges. The main written report was done in Chinese, but I do aim to translate it to English at some point(Inshallah).
