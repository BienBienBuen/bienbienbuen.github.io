## Project Overview

A literature review of galois theory and the insolvability of the quintic equation, submitted as the Extended Essay for the IB Diploma. Do forgive the simple, and often times naive use of language (by a perhaps overly ambitious 18 year old), but the main aim was to give a layman's explanation of the concepts and proofs from scratch.
