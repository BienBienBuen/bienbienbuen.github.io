## Project Overview

A literature review of the book 'Solitons, Instantons, and Twistors' by Dunajski, starting with a brief introduction of prerequisite knowledge(classical mechanics), followed by an in-depth treatment of the inverse scattering transform of the KdV equation as a Riemann Hilbert problem. The wish is to finish extending it to a geometric disgussion in the context of field theories, but that section is still a work in progress as I update these notes while filling more gaps in differential geometry.
