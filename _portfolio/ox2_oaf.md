## Project Overview

We investigated different trading strategies involving VIX, at different time horizons with different types of arbitrage. I specifically focused on the volatility premium and ways of extracting it while protecting against tail events (i.e. with added risk management). 


Additionally, a few good reads I've found on VIX while researching the topic:
